What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

At first this assignment was really confusing to me, as I missed the class it was assigned on and I couldn't even understand what I was asked to do. I went to TA hours for the first time and it helped to clear the instructions for me and I could properly start the work. I feeled like things still confused me and I wouldn't be able to submit the HW in time, so I asked for extension and went to office hours, which helped me to finish things up. 
One thing I would recommend to future students in CSC120 is to ask for help if needed. I rarely go to office hours and never went to TA hours, but once I did, it helped me a lot.
